            <h1>Cloud offering â€“ Looking for partners</h1>
            <p>The Connecter application is built as a SAAS service that can either be produced in the cloud and made available to users, or it can be produced in a private / hybrid cloud for use by a specific company or purpose. </p>
            
            <p>It can also very easily be customized and integrated into an already existing application. This could be any application with a Web front-end. The Connecter user interface is easily customizable with a different UX design.</p>
            
            <p>For authentication Connecter supports OAuth2 and also Shibboleth/SAML, which makes integration with other applications really easy. If the other application provides an API, then Connecter can access additional data that can be used to pre-populate meeting rooms and other things. </p>
            
            <p>Connecter scales both horizontally into a cluster, or vertically into a large single machine. For many smaller conferences and added resiliency a cluster is the architecture of choice. In order to support large conferences a big single host or several larger hosts can be used. Connecter also supports auto-scaling where elastic capacity is added automatically as needed.</p>
            
            <p>The Connecter audio/video technology is state-of-the art. It supports Scalable Video Coding (SVC) and simulcast using VP8/VP9 codecs with Chrome browsers and also H.264 video codecs with Firefox. Simulcast allows adaptive bandwidth allocation per stream, adjusting video quality based on current network conditions and client requirements. This is especially useful for mobile connections. The quality and resolution of the video stream auto-adjusts.</p>
            
            <p>Connecter also supports large conferences. The number of tiles offered to participants auto-adjusts based on available bandwidth.</p>
            
            <p>We are looking for interested parties to use the Connecter service or technology. If this sounds like something you might be interested in, contact us. We are easy to work with.</p>
