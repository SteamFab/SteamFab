            <h1>No more presentations</h1>
            <p>We got bored with meetings. We found ourselves listening with one ear while doing something else in parallel all the time. The problem really was the ‘listening’ part. Someone presented something sharing a screen and you had to patiently wait until that person finished and control was turned over to, well the next presenter. </p>

            <p>Listening to presentations is boring. It is not productive. We really wanted to collaborate and co-create things in real-time. You know, like having a white-board session while being remote. We tried this with existing video conferencing products. You awkwardly try to point the camera built into your laptop at the white-board while someone is drawing, and what you get is a bad and distorted picture and a white-board obscured by the person’s back. There got to be a better way.</p>

            <p>Now with Connecter we can sit around a table and everyone uses a laptop to participate. So local participants see the same thing our remote participants see. It’s really like being face-to-face all the time. </p>

            <p>The markup feature is what we like the most. You can use it for funny things too and a little humor always helps. We still have a lot of ideas on how we can improve it. We will keep working on it, so keep your feedback coming.</p>
